# IdioMatch





## Overview
**IdioMatch is a matchmaking service that lets you teach a language to another person, and in exchange, be taught a language by that same person!**



**Here is how it works in just 3 simple steps:**

1. Tell us what languages you are fluent in and what languages you are trying to learn.

2. Get connected with someone who is learning your language, but can also teach you theirs.

3. Start communicating via WhatsApp, Skype, or email address and begin learning a new language with a native speaker!

inputing my name, main language, and learning language.
- On the see-how-it-works page, I want to see my new test profile appear with the # of matches I have made and all the users that I have matched with.
- For the prototype users, I want to see their main languages, language that they are trying to learn, whether or not they have matched with me and I also want to see phony contact information.

## Pseudocode

**Filtration System:**

- Six language filters

- Select one main language from six languages

- Select one learning language from the same six languages

- Click a filter button that will make an axios.get call to the imd (idiomatch database)

##### Logic for filtering through selections

```
If selectedLanguage = mainLanguage.english 
					&& 
selectedLearningLanguage = learningLanguage.spanish


Display from users table the following data:

[Profile_pic;username;main_language;location;
learning_language; skype; email address; WhatsApp number] 

WHERE 
mainLanguage.language = mainLanguage.spanish 
						&&
learningLanguage.language = learningLanguage.english
```

##### Rendering the data on the front-end

```
For each matching_user; render

<div class='user-card'>
<img>users.profile_pic </img>
<h4>users.username</h4>
<p> Main Language <span>users.mainLanguage</span></p>
<p>Learning Language <span>users.learningLanguage/span></p>
<p>Skype <span>users.skype</span></p>
<p>Email Address <span>users.email</span></p>
<p>Learning Language<span>users.WhatsApp</span></p>
</div>

```
