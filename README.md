## Overview
**IdioMatch is a matchmaking service that lets you teach a language to another person, and in exchange, be taught a language by that same person!**



**Here is how it works in just 3 simple steps:**

1. Tell us what languages you are fluent in and what languages you are trying to learn.

2. Get connected with someone who is learning your language, but can also teach you theirs.

3. Start communicating via WhatsApp, Skype, or email address and begin learning a new language with a native speaker!
